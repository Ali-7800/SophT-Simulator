# SophT_examples
Example cases illustrating SophT usage.

This branch corresponds to the development of flow-structure
interaction cases (2D and 3D), using `SophT` as a backend.
The cases are coded up directly using kernels from the
`dev_backend` of `SophT`. For installing `SophT`, instructions
can be found [here](https://github.com/SophT-Team/SophT/tree/dev_backend#readme).

Additional dependencies involved in post-processing of data
can be installed by
```{sh}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
